\section*{Problem 2}

To implement \code{RandomWalk} the program keeps track of the x,y-position
using variables and whenever it makes a step it draws a dot in this point. The
direction of the step is a four-way choice between up, down, left and right
with equal distribution of chance and a random selection.

This behaviour is repeated until the random walk leads to a position outside
the predefined boundaries, after which the program is terminated.
