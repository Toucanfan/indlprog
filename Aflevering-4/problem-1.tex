\section*{Problem 1}
The task was to write 3 classes - Forlag, Tidsskrift and Artikel -
with the purpose of describing a publisher, magazine, an article and their mutual relations.

Each class have some member fields and methods that are bound to instances of the class - i.e. they are not static. The values of the fields describe each instance, and the methods operate on them.
Some classes have accessor and mutator methods and thus a private field holding the data, whereas
other fields are public and have none of such methods due to their simplicity.

Each class also have a customly defined constructor that takes some parameters that are considered
``essential'' (i.e. they cannot be null) for an instance to be able to function.

Finally each class defines a toString()-method, which returns a string showing how the constructor
was called (provided its arguments has not been changed since).

All the classes are tested by the static main() method in the class ArtikelTest.
