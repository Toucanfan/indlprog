\section*{Problem 1}

The task was to implement classes for representing literary references. Using
classes as abstractions it should be possible for the \code{Artikel}-class to
have instances of other \code{Artikel}s which in turn have instances of
\code{Tidsskrift} and in turn of \code{Forlag}.

When an \code{Artikel}-class is correctly instantiated and set up, passing it
to \code{print} (or calling \code{.toString}) yields the following output:
